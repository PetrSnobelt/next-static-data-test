### Next static data test

I try to solve need of some global server side data in both server and client without refetching it

## Details
 - Solution is based on custom `renderPage` in _document.js 
 - and then in _app.js I used `__NEXT_DATA__` on client
 
## Another possible solutions (previous attempt)
